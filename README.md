# (Deprecated) CustomBeatmapsV2
Custom Beatmaps, 2nd edition, integrated with Package Manager &amp; Online Mode

This is an UNOFFICIAL mod for Unbeatable \[white label\] that lets you play and create custom beatmaps.

**[Visit our Discord](https://discord.gg/XzqMhRMmhC)** to download community custom beatmaps and get help with mapping/playing custom maps

## Features

- Custom Beatmap support on top of the vanilla game
- Beatmaps are pickable in a easily viewable list instead of using the in-game UI (which granted is way cooler, but slow)
- Mapping tools: Play and test your beatmaps while creating them

## Planned Features

- Online Mode: Community beatmaps will be uploadable from the discord and downloadable straight from the game
- Online Leaderboards: A competitive scene can form around user beatmaps, even if we already know cheryl is going to beat everyone

## Installation

0) Make sure UNBEATABLE is up to date and patched to version
1) Locate Unbeatable's game files (Steam Instructions. For Itch just open the game installation folder)
    1) Locate `UNBEATABLE [white label]` in your Steam Library
    2) Right click `UNBEATABLE [white label]` and click `Properties`
    3) In the open panel, navigate to `LOCAL FILES`
    4) In the `LOCAL FILES` page, click `Browse...`
2) Uninstall Old Custom Beatmaps Mod (if you have it, otherwise skip this step)
   1) Delete the `BepInEx` folder
   2) You don't need to do any conversion work for your old beatmaps (the ones in `UNBEATABLE [white label]_Data\StreamingAssets\USER_BEATMAPS`). You may create a backup copy if you wish, but **leave these old beatmaps (or copies of them) in this folder, they will be converted automatically**.
3) Drag and drop the contents of the mod's zip file directly into the Unbeatable game directory (same directory as `UNBEATABLE [white label].exe`)

4) Open the game. If the mod was installed correctly, you will see a button in the bottom right corner called `CUSTOM`.
5) Convert Old beatmaps (optional): If old beatmaps are detected, an extra button will appear to the left of the `CUSTOM` button. Press this to enter a conversion screen. Once this conversion has been made

## Making Your Own Custom Beatmaps

I highly suggest taking a look at [Ratismal's Original Beatmap tutorial](https://github.com/Ratismal/CustomBeats/blob/master/creation.md), made way before CustomBeatmapsV2 or CustomBeatmapsV1.
